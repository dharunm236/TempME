# TempME Data Structure Report

## Walks Structure
- Walks is a tuple with 5 elements
- Item 0: numpy array with shape (1, 90, 6) and dtype int64
- Item 1: numpy array with shape (1, 90, 3) and dtype int64
- Item 2: numpy array with shape (1, 90, 3) and dtype float64
- Item 3: numpy array with shape (1, 90, 1) and dtype int64
- Item 4: numpy array with shape (1, 90, 1) and dtype float64

## Subgraph Structure
- Subgraph is a tuple with 3 elements
- Item 0: list with 2 elements
- Item 1: list with 2 elements
- Item 2: list with 2 elements

## Understanding TempME Data
1. **Walks**: Represent temporal walks in the graph capturing interaction patterns
   - Node sequences: Which nodes interact
   - Edge sequences: The connections between nodes
   - Time sequences: When these interactions happen

2. **Subgraphs**: Represent the local neighborhood structure
   - Node records: Which nodes are involved
   - Edge records: How nodes are connected
   - Time records: Temporal information

3. **Link Prediction Task**:
   - **Input**: Source node, target node, and their temporal subgraphs
   - **Output**: Probability of future interaction between source and target
   - **Explanation**: Identifies which temporal patterns influenced the prediction

4. **Visualization Guide**:
   - **Edge Importance Heatmaps**: Show which connections most influenced the prediction
   - **Component Visualizations**: Compare importance of source vs target patterns
   - **Temporal Walk Example**: Shows how nodes interact over time in a specific walk
   - **Subgraph Structure**: Shows the connectivity pattern in the local neighborhood
